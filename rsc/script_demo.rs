//! A simple demo hsmt script.
//!
//! An hsmt script is a Rust-flavored syntax for (a subset of) [SMT-LIB 2][smtlib]. Such scripts
//! allow to perform *satisfiability checks* on formulas; this is done with three basic commands.
//! 
//! All commands can be written function-style `command(args)` or block-style `command { args }`.
//! Some commands also allow `command!(args)` and `command! { args }` such as `check_sat!()`,
//! `get_model!()`, `println!(...)`... and all commands that produce an output or exit the script
//! (including `panic!("message")`).
//! 
//! The script below showcases all commands available. Note that hsmt scripts, unlike SMT-LIB 2
//! scripts, can branch using if-then-else(-otherwise). Conditions in branchings can only be
//! check-sat results. Also unlike SMT-LIB 2, hsmt scripts let you bind (name) check-sat results
//! in a (meta-)variable usable in branchings.

/// First, *declaring variables* (*constants* in SMT-LIB 2) is necessary to later write formulas
/// that use these variables.
vars {

	cnt: int,
	/// Next counter value.
	next_cnt: int,
	/// True if resetting.

/// Next, we write formulas and *assert* them. This tells the solver *"I want this formula to be
/// true"*.
assert {
	// This `=` is **NOT** an assignment. It is a **constraint** comparing the value of `next_cnt`
	// to the value of the right-hand side. It does **NOT** "set" `next_cnt`'s value. In a context
	// where `next_cnt`'s value is `7` and `reset` is true for instance, then this formula becomes
	// `7 = 0`, which is `false`.
